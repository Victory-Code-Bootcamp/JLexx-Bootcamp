            I'm Jacob, originally from Eastern Washington.
            <br /><br />
            I was introduced to computers in the early to mid-90s. I taught myself
            how to build and customize them. I did some software tech support for
            Microsoft.
            <br /><br />
            Later in prison, I earned the Web App Developer certificate
            (EdCC/un-loop). I wanted to continue learning about computers and had
            hoped to slide into a program that built upon my certification.
            <br /><br />
            <span id="greyText"
            >Some rogue 1-liner code (hashtag triangle) I wrote inside:
            <br /><br />
            &nbsp; &nbsp; for (let s = ''; s.length < 7; console.log((s = s +
            '#')));
            </span>
            <br /><br />
            <span>
            <!-- This span tag is a substitute for the second par, so as to include this par in the same card -->
            But that wasn't the case... until Troy from un-loop contacted me about
            Victory Coding Bootcamp. <br /><br />
            Now, here I am!

        <div id="interestsAndHobbies">
        <span class="cardTitle">Interests & Hobbies:</span>
        <br /><br />
        My interests extend far and wide.
        <br />
        <br />
        But there are some hobbies that I really get lost in.
